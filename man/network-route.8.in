.SH NAME
network-route \- Network Route Configuration Control Program

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBnetwork [OPTIONS] route add <network> [--gateway=..., --unreachable, --prohibit, --blackhole]\fR
.P
\fBnetwork [OPTIONS] route remove <network>\fR
.P
\fBnetwork [OPTIONS] route list\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
The route subcommands, help to configure static routes.
.PP
It is possible to create and remove static routes.

.SH COMMANDS
The \fBnetwork route\fR command offers various sub commands:

\fBadd <network> [--gateway=..., --unreachable, --prohibit, --blackhole]\fR
.RS 4
A new route may be added by the \fBadd\fR command.
It is always required to pass a valid network prefix (\fB<network>\fR), which
can be either IPv6 or IPv4.
.PP
For unicast routes, the \fB--gateway=<gateway>\fR option must be passed, where
\fB<gateway>\fR is a valid IP address of the same protocol type as the network
prefix is.
.PP
Use \fB--unreachable\fR, \fB--prohibit\fR, \fB--blackhole\fR can be used to create
of that type. See \fBROUTE TYPES\fR below for more information about these options.
.RE
.PP

\fBremove <network>\fR
.RS 4
A route can be removed with this command.
.PP
\fB<network>\fR is the network prefix of a existing route.
.RE
.PP

\fBlist [--ipv6|--ipv4]\fR
.RS 4
Shows a list of all configured routes.
.PP
Pass the protocol as shown above to filter.

.SH ROUTE TYPES

\fBunicast\fR
.RS 4
A unicast route is the most common route in routing tables. It is a route to a destination
network address, which describes the path to the destination.
Use the \fB--gateway=...\fR option to create such a route.
.RE
.PP

\fBunreachable\fR
.RS 4
When a route is determined and the routing decision process returns a destination with
an unreachable route type, an ICMP unreachable message is generated and returned to
the source address.
.RE
.PP

\fBprohibit\fR
.RS 4
This works like an \fBunreachable\fR route, but the returned ICMP message is an
ICMP prohibited message.
.RE
.PP

\fBblackhole\fR
.RS 4
Packets matching this kind of route are silently discarded. There will be no ICMP message
sent to the source and no packet be forwarded.
.RE
.PP

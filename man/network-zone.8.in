.SH NAME
network-zone \- Network Configuration Control Program

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBnetwork [OPTIONS] zone create <zone> ...\fR
.P
\fBnetwork [OPTIONS] zone <zone> command ...\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
By the zone subcommands, it is very easy to configure network zones.
.PP
It is possible to create zones and remove them. Zones may also
be brought up and down and reconfigured. Their status may be viewed
as well.

.SH OPTIONS
The \fBnetwork zone\fR command offers various commands:

\fBcreate <zone> <hook> [options]\fR
.RS 4
A new zone may be created by the \fBcreate\fR command. There are at least two arguments
required.
.PP
\fB<zone>\fR must be valid name for a zone which does not already exist.
\fB<hook>\fR is a valid zone hook which may require additional options.
.RE
.PP

\fBremove <zone>\fR
.RS 4
A zone can be simple removed with this command.
.PP
There are two possible ways to remove a zone. The case is when the zone is not up. Then,
it will be removed immediately. When the zone is current up and used, it will tagged
to be remove later, after it has been brought down.
.RE
.PP

For all other commands, the name of the zone needs to be passed first:
\fBnetwork zone <zone> command\fR.

\fB<zone> edit [OPTIONS]\fR
.RS 4
The settings of a zone may be edited after it has been created. The options that can
be passed depend on the hook that is used for the zone. Run \fBnetwork zone <zone> edit --help\fR
to learn more about that.
.PP
It normally is required to restart/reload the zone until the new settings are taken into account.
.RE
.PP

\fB<zone> [up|down]\fR
.RS 4
These commands will bring the zone up/down. This is done without control of systemd, therefore
not intended to be done in a productive environment. However, these commands may be used for
debugging.
.RE
.PP

\fB<zone> status\fR
.RS 4
This will show some detailed information about the state if the specified zone.
.RE

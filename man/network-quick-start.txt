network-quick-start - Quick Start Guide for Networking

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The link:network[8] is a very powerful command that allows you to configure
the entire networking stack.
Unfortunately that makes it quite complicated to use as well.

This guide tries to be a good starting point to set up basic networking with
the 'network' command.

=== Adding an Uplink Zone

The first step is to create a new uplink zone with name 'upl0'.

This zone will be of the link:network-zone-bridge[8] type which is the default
for all local networks.

------------
# network zone new upl0 bridge
------------

The zone will be created and brought up immediately.

=== Attaching Ports

To connect the zone to the physical world outside of our box we will need
to attach ports to the zone. That is done with a single command.
To execute this command, we will need to know which ports are available.
One of the easiest way to find out about that is to use the auto-completion
feature of the shell like this:

------------
# network zone upl0 port attach [TAB] [TAB]
------------

That will list all not yet attached ports. The following command will actually
attach the port (which is 'p0' in this example).

-----------
# network zone upl0 port attach p0
-----------

You can as well get a list of all detected devices, zones and ports by running:

-----------
# network device list
-----------

To a zone of the 'bridge' type you may attach more than just one port if you
wish to.

=== IP Connectivity

After a zone has been created and ports have been attached, you are now
able to add IP connectivity.

The easiest way to do that is using DHCP which can be enabled by this simple command:

------------
# network zone upl0 config new dhcp
------------

=== Debugging

You may see the current status of the network by running this command:

------------
# network status
------------

The entire network can be restarted by running:

------------
# network restart
------------

.SH NAME
network-zone-bridge \- Network Configuration Control Program

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBnetwork [OPTIONS] zone create <zone> bridge ...\fR
.P
All options may be edited on zones which have already been set up with the \fBbridge\fR hook:
.P
\fBnetwork [OPTIONS] zone <zone> edit ...\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
The bridge hook creates an ethernet bridge which acts as an unmanaged network
switch. It contains one or multiple phyisical network interfaces or virtual
devices which will be connected to each other.
.PP
The bridge hook is the prefered hook for local area network zones which are
connected to an ethernet network.

.SH OPTIONS
The \fBbridge\fR hook offers various configuration options:

\fB--stp\fR = [\fBon\fR|off]
.RS 4
This option enables or disable the use of the \fBSpanning Tree Protocol\fR (STP).
This protocol is used to avoid loops in networks by dynamically disabling packet
forwarding on links.
.PP
It is highly recommended to leave this option enabled when you add more than
one device to the zone. Read below how the behaviour of STP can be changed.
.RE
.PP

\fB--mtu\fR = 1500
.RS 4
Sets the default MTU of the bridge. All ports in the bridge must support this
MTU.
.RE
.PP

\fB--mac\fR = ...
.RS 4
By this option, you may define the MAC address of the bridge. If this option
is missing, a random MAC address will be generated.
.RE
.PP

Spanning Tree Protocol configuration options:

\fB--stp-mode\fR = [\fBrstp\fR|stp]
.RS 4
When STP is enabled, this option will set the operational mode which can either be:
.PP
* \fBSpanning Tree Protocol IEEE 802.1W\fR (stp) was introduced in 1998 by Radia
Perlman.
.P
* \fBRapid Spanning Tree Protocol IEEE 802.1D\fR (rstp) which has much faster convergence
times and was introduced in 2004. This is the default option.
.RE
.PP

\fB--stp-forward-delay\fR = 0
.RS 4
This sets the default time the interfaces are hold off after they have been added
to a bridge. The default value is 0.
.RE
.PP

\fB--stp-hello\fR = 2
.RS 4
This option defines how often a hello message should be sent. The value is given in seconds
and the default is 2.
.RE
.PP

\fB--stp-priority\fR = 512
.RS 4
The STP priority sets the ranking of this network device within the network. The bridge
with the best rank (0 is best) will become the root bridge.
.RE
.PP

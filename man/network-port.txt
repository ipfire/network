== DESCRIPTION
This command creates, deletes, changes and views the configuration
and status of ports.

NOTE: A port is a physical or virtual device that is directly connected
to an other network. It connects those and zones together.
The 'network device' command shows status information of network devices
and other things.

== COMMANDS
The following commands are understood:

`new HOOK ...`::
	A new port may be created with this command.
	HOOK must be a valid hook which may require more options.

`destroy PORT`::
	Destroys the port PORT.
	The port is removed from any zones it is attached to and shut down.

For all other commands, the name of the port needs to be passed first:

include::include-color.txt[]

`create`::
	This will create devices for the existing port PORT.
	+
	This does not create a new port. It will just create the (possibly
	virtual) interface this port (i.e. create an interface for a WiFi
	module or a VLAN device).
	+
	The interface is not brought up. Use the `up` command to do that.

include::include-description.txt[]

`down`::
	Shuts down the port.

`edit`::
	This command can be used to alter the configuration of a port.
	Consult the documentation of the port hook to find out what is supported.

`identify`::
	This command will make the port flash for a few seconds
	so that you can identify the correct network adapters
	in the system.
	+
	This is not supported by all network adapters.

`remove`::
	This will remove an existing PORT.
	+
	This does not destroy the port. It inverses the operation performed
	by the 'create' command.

`status`::
	This will show some detailed information about the status
	of the specified port.

`up`::
	Brings up the port. It has to be created first.

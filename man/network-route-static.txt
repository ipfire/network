== NAME
network-route - Manage Static Routing

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
'network route static' COMMAND ...
'network route static add' NETWORK [--gateway=GATEWAY,--unreachable,--prohibit,--blackhole] [--mtu=MTU]
'network route static remove' NETWORK
'network route static list' [--protocol=ipv6|ipv4]

== DESCRIPTION
This command helps to manage routes.

== COMMANDS
The following commands are understood:

'add' NETWORK ...::
	A new route may be added by the 'add' command. It is required to pass a
	valid network prefix NETWORK, which can be either IPv6 or IPv4.
	+
	For unicast routes, the '--gateway=GATEWAY' option must be passed, where
	GATEWAY is a valid IP address of the same protocol type as the network
	prefix is.
	+
	Use '--unreachable', '--prohibit', '--blackhole' can be used to create of
	that type. See ROUTE TYPES below for more information about these options.
	+
	The optional '--mtu=MTU' parameter defines the MTU along the path to the
	destination and must be an integer number. This will show you very
	detailed information about the given device.

'remove' NETWORK::
	A route can be removed with this command.
	+
	NETWORK is the network prefix of an existing route.

'list'::
	Shows a list of all configured routes.
	+
	Output can be filtered by passing --protocol=[ipv6|ipv4].

== ROUTE TYPES

[horizontal]
'unicast'::
	A unicast route is the most common route in routing tables. It is a route to
	a destination network address, which describes the path to the destination.
	Use the '--gateway=GATEWAY' option to create such a route.

'unreachable'::
	When a route is determined and the routing decision process returns a
	destination with an unreachable route type, an ICMP unreachable message is
	generated and returned to the source address.

'prohibit'::
	This works like an _unreachable_ route, but the returned ICMP message is an
	ICMP prohibited message.

'blackhole'::
	Packets matching this kind of route are silently discarded.
	There will be no ICMP message sent to the source and no packet be forwarded.

== NAME
network-zone-modem - Configure serial modems

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
`network zone new ZONE modem ...`

== DESCRIPTION
The modem hook uses a serial interface to establish a PPP session to an Internet
Service Provider. This method is used by 56k modems and mobile networks like
LTE, GSM and 3G.

== OPTIONS
The following options are understood:

`--device=DEVICE`::
	Sets the serial device that is used to connect. Example: /dev/ttyUSB0

`--monitor-device=DEVICE`::
	The optional monitor device is used to collect status information like
	signal strength and link quality while the connection is established.

`--imsi=IMSI`::
	Set the IMSI of the SIM card inside the wireless modem to identify it when
	it is plugged in at runtime.

`--pin=PIN`::
	The PIN number of the SIM card.
	This will be used to unlock the SIM card when it is locked.

`--apn=APN`::
	Sets the Access Point Name (APN) that the modem connects to.

`--phone-number=PHONE-NUMBER`::
	Sets the phone number that is dialled by the modem when the connection is
	to be established.

`--username=USERNAME`::
	Sets the username for authentication.

`--password=PASSWORD`::
	Sets the password for authentication.
	+
	Use the `--auth=` option to transmit it in a secure manner to the provider.

`--baudrate=921600`::
	The baudrate for the serial link to the modem.

`--mtu=N`::
	Sets the default MTU of the PPP connection.

`--auth=[chap|pap]`::
	Define the authentication method that is used to authenticate against your
	provider. The default is to use the provider's preference.

	* _Challange-Handshake Authentication Protocol_ (`chap`) is the preferred,
	secure method.
	* _Password Authentication Protocol_ (`pap`) sends the plaintext password
	to the authentication server which is the reason why it should be avoided.

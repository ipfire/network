network-performance-tuning - Performance Tuning for Networking

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This page contains a summary of some performance tuning techniques
that this system is using.

=== SMP Affinity

This system is automatically using SMP affinity for every physical
network controller, if supported.

A processor core is assigned to handle all interrupts of a certain
network controller which will result in minimising cache misses,
reducing network latency and quite possibly increasing throughput.

The algorithm is trying to balance all network controllers across
all processors.

See /proc/interrups for the distribution of interrupts.

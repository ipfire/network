== NAME
network-zone-bridge - Manage network zones

== SYNOPSIS
[verse]
'network zone new ZONE bridge' ...
'network zone ZONE edit' ...

== DESCRIPTION
The bridge hook creates an ethernet bridge which acts as an unmanaged network
switch. It contains one or multiple physical network interfaces or virtual
devices which will be connected to each other.

The bridge hook is the preferred hook for local area network zones which are
connected to an ethernet network.

== OPTIONS
The following options are understood:

'--address=ADDRESS'::
	By this option, you may define the MAC address of the bridge. If this option
	is missing, a random MAC address will be generated.

'--mtu=MTU'::
	Sets the default MTU of the bridge.
	All ports in the bridge must support this MTU value.

'--stp=[_on_|off]'::
	This option enables or disables use of the _Spanning Tree Protocol_ (STP).
	This protocol is used to avoid loops in networks by dynamically disabling
	packet forwarding on links.
	+
	It is highly recommended to leave this option enabled when you add more
	than one device to the zone. Read below how the behaviour of STP can be changed.

Spanning Tree Protocol (802.1D) configuration options:

'--stp-forward-delay=_0_'::
	This sets the default time the interfaces are hold off after they have been
	added to a bridge. The default value is 0.

'--stp-hello=_2_'::
	This option defines how often a hello message should be sent. The value is
	given in seconds and the default is 2.

'--stp-priority=512'::
	The STP priority sets the ranking of this network device within the network.
	The bridge with the best rank (0 is best) will become the root bridge.
